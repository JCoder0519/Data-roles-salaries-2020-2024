            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The field of data-related roles has experienced significant growth and evolution over the past few years, with a surge in demand for professionals skilled in data analysis, data science, machine learning, and other related domains. As organizations across various industries continue to recognize the value of data-driven decision-making, the demand for skilled data professionals has led to increased competition and scrutiny regarding salaries and compensation packages within this sector.

                In this project, I aim to explore the potential determinants and trends of salaries in data-related roles from 2020 to 2024. Specifically, I will address four key tasks:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Task 1: Understanding Data Jobs Salary Trend from 2020-2024</h3>
                      <p>Analyze the salary trends in data-related roles over the past five years to identify any notable patterns, fluctuations, or overall growth in compensation within the industry. By examining salary data from 2020 to 2024, we seek to gain insights into the trajectory of salaries for data professionals during this period.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Task 2: Exploring the Impact of Employment Type on Salary</h3>
                      <p>Investigate the impact of employment type (such as full-time, part-time, contract, or freelance) on salary levels within the data-related sector. By comparing salaries across different employment types, we aim to discern whether certain types of employment arrangements are associated with higher or lower compensation for data professionals.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Task 3: Exploring the Impact of Experience Level & Company Size on Salary</h3>
                      <p>Examine how experience level and company size influence salary levels within the data-related industry. By analyzing salary data based on experience levels (such as entry-level, mid-level, senior-level) and company sizes (small, medium, large), we aim to identify any correlations or trends between these factors and salary levels.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>Task 4: Exploring the Median Salary of the Top 20 Most Common Jobs</h3>
                      <p>Focus on the top 20 most common job titles within the data-related sector and explore the median salary for each of these positions. By examining salary data for the most prevalent job titles, we aim to provide insights into the typical compensation levels for various roles within the data industry.</p>
                    </li>
                    <h3>Task 5: Explore Salary Information by Country</h3>
                      <p>Investigate salary information by country to understand how compensation varies geographically in the data-related roles.</p>
                  </ul>
                
                Through these analyses, we aim to provide valuable insights into the salary dynamics within the data-related sector, helping professionals, employers, and policymakers better understand the factors influencing compensation trends and make informed decisions regarding hiring, compensation packages, and career development strategies within this rapidly evolving field.</p>

                <h2>Data Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The dataset that I am going to use for this project is called “Latest_Data_Science_Salaries” downloaded from Kaggle.com. It is a 646KB csv file that contains the following 11 attributes: Employment Type, Experience Level, Expertise Level, Salary, Salary Currency, Company Location, Salary in USD, Employee Residence, Company Size, and Year. The dataset has 5736 observations in total which is a relatively sufficient amount for my analysis. The dataset provides valuable insights into the compensation trends and variations in the field of data science from 2020 to 2024 and its breadth allows for a comprehensive analysis of salary determinants across different market segments.

                <figcaption><strong>Visualization takeaway:</strong>This visualization presents the salary trends for data-related jobs from 2020 to 2023(2024 was excluded because there is only available observation for medium size company but not the two other sizes), differentiated by company size: small, medium, and large. The key takeaway is that salary trends vary significantly with company size. Salaries in medium-sized companies have shown a strong upward trend, surpassing both small and large companies by 2023. Large companies have experienced moderate salary growth, maintaining higher salaries than small companies throughout the period but falling behind medium companies in the latter years. Small companies show a relatively flat trend, with minor fluctuations and the lowest salaries across the board. The shaded areas represent the variance or uncertainty in the salary projections, indicating more significant variability in large and medium companies while the small company salaries remain fairly consistent with less variance. </figcaption>

                <figcaption><strong>Visualization takeaway:</strong>This bar chart illustrates the median and mean salaries for various experience levels. The key takeaway is that both median and mean salaries increase with experience. For mid-level experience, the median salary is $105,320, and the mean is slightly higher at $116,884.33. At the entry-level, the median salary is substantially lower at $74,540, with a mean of $84,356.37, indicating a wider distribution of entry-level salaries with some earning significantly more. For senior-level positions, the median jumps to $153,400, and the mean to $161,575.74, showing a closer distribution between the two. The executive level sees the highest salaries, with a median of $182,160 and a mean even higher at $188,840.04, suggesting that some executives earn considerably more than the median, skewing the mean upward. The consistency between the median and mean salaries across the experience levels suggests a relatively symmetrical salary distribution, particularly at the mid and senior levels.</figcaption>

                <iframe src="altair_box_plot.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                <figcaption><strong>Visualization takeaway:</strong>This box plot shows the salary distribution across different employment types: contract, freelance, full-time, and part-time. The key observations are:

                    1. Full-time roles have the widest salary range and the highest outliers, indicating that full-time employees can achieve significantly higher earnings, likely due to a mix of senior roles and high-paying industries. The median salary for full-time positions is also higher compared to other employment types, suggesting a generally better compensation for full-time workers.
                    
                    2. Contract positions have a lower median salary than full-time roles, but higher than freelance and part-time. The range is narrower than full-time positions, suggesting less variability in contract work salaries.
                    
                    3. Freelance work shows the lowest median salary and a smaller interquartile range, indicating that freelancers generally earn less with less variability in their earnings compared to contract and full-time roles.
                    
                    4. Part-time work has the lowest spread of salaries, with the lowest median, and no visible outliers, which could be due to a cap on earnings associated with fewer working hours.
                    
                    Overall, full-time positions seem to offer the most lucrative opportunities with the potential for high earnings, while part-time roles are the least lucrative in terms of salary.</figcaption>
